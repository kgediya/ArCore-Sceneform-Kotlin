Sceneform provides the high level API for rendering 3D models using Java. This helps make creating AR experiences easier.

This project introduces some of the Sceneform API and walks you through:

-   Adding the Sceneform fragment to an Android application which handles ARCore session creation, requesting camera permission, as well as provide common UX elements.
-   Importing 3D models into your Android Studio project.
-   Placing multiple objects in the scene using a node based scene graph.
-   Handling gestures for placing and moving objects in the AR scene.
-   Taking a picture of the AR experience.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these before starting the codelab:

-   Android Studio 3.1 or greater
- Kotlin Support
-   [ARCore compatible device](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/#supported_devices)  and USB cable
-   Access to the internet to download dependencies while building the app

Later on we'll copy some 3D assets for the codelab from the sample project on GitHub. You can  [download these sample assets for the project](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/sceneform-intro/raw/master/sampledata.zip). The zip file also includes the completed project for reference.

For more information about getting started, see the  [Sceneform documentation](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/sceneform/).
