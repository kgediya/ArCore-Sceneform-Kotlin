## Control the pointer

Go back to  **`MainActivity.kt`**  and let's initialize the pointer and add the code to enable and disable it based on the tracking state from ARCore, and if the user is looking at a plane detected by ARCore.

Add 3 member variables to  **MainActivity**:

-   `PointerDrawable pointer`
-   `boolean isTracking`  - indicating if ARCore is in tracking state.
-   `boolean isHitting`  - indicating the user is looking at a plane. The method for figuring this out is called  _hitTest_  which is why it is called isHitting.

```
private var pointer = PointerDrawable()  
private var isTracking: Boolean = false  
private var isHitting: Boolean = false
```

At the bottom of  **`onCreate()`**  add a listener to the ArSceneView scene which will get called before processing every frame. In this listener we can make ARCore API calls and update the status of the pointer.

We'll use a lambda to first call the fragment's  `onUpdate`  method, then we'll call a new method in MainActivity called onUpdate.

```
fragment!!.arSceneView.scene.addOnUpdateListener { frameTime ->  fragment!!.onUpdate(frameTime)}
```

## Implement  **`onUpdate()`**.

First, update the tracking state. If ARCore is not tracking, remove the pointer until tracking is restored.

Next, if ARCore is tracking, check for the gaze of the user hitting a plane detected by ARCore and enable the pointer accordingly.

```
private fun onUpdate() {  
    var trackingChanged = updateTracking()  
    var contentView = findViewById<View>(android.R.id.content)  
    if (trackingChanged) {  
        if (isTracking) {  
            contentView.overlay.add(pointer)  
        } else {  
            contentView.overlay.remove(pointer)  
        }  
        contentView.invalidate()  
    }  
    if (isTracking)  
    {  
        var hitTestChanged = updateHitTest()  
        if (hitTestChanged)  
        {  
            pointer.setEnabled(isHitting)  
            contentView.invalidate()  
        }  
    }  
}
```

**`updateTracking()`**  uses ARCore's camera state and returns true if the tracking state has changed since last call.

```
private fun updateTracking(): Boolean {  
    val frame = fragment?.getArSceneView()?.arFrame  
  val wasTracking = isTracking  
 isTracking = frame != null && frame.camera.trackingState === TrackingState.TRACKING  
  return isTracking != wasTracking  
}
```

**`updateHitTest()`**  also uses ARCore to call  `Frame.hitTest()`. As soon as any hit is detected, the method returns. We also need the center of the screen for this method, so add a helper method  **`getScreenCenter()`**  as well.

```
private fun updateHitTest(): Boolean {  
    val frame = fragment?.arSceneView?.arFrame  
  var pt = getScreenCenter()  
    var hits: List<HitResult>  
    var wasHitting = isHitting  
 isHitting = false  
 if (frame != null) {  
        hits = frame.hitTest(pt.x.toFloat(), pt.y.toFloat())  
        for (hit in hits) {  
            val trackable = hit.trackable  
  if (trackable is Plane && (trackable as Plane).isPoseInPolygon(hit.hitPose)) {  
                isHitting = true  
 break  }  
        }  
    }  
    return wasHitting != isHitting  
}

private fun getScreenCenter(): android.graphics.Point {  
    var vw = findViewById<View>(android.R.id.content)    
    return android.graphics.Point(vw.width / 2, vw.height / 2)  
}
```

Great! Now we have the pointer implemented, let's try it out and make sure it works.
