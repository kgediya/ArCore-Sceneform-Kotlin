## Update Gradle scripts

In the gradle script we need to enable Java 8 and add the dependencies for Sceneform.

## Enable Java 8

Sceneform uses language constructs from Java 8. For projects that have a min API level less than 26, you need to explicitly add support for Java 8.

In the  **`android {}`**  section of  **app/build.gradle** add:

```
compileOptions {
   sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
   targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

## Add the ARCore and Sceneform dependencies

In the  **app/build.gradle**  file add dependencies for the Sceneform API and the Sceneform UX elements.

In the  **`dependency {}`**  section add:

```
implementation "com.google.ar.sceneform.ux:sceneform-ux:1.8.0"
implementation 'com.google.ar.sceneform:assets:1.8.0'
```

Press the "Sync now" link to update the project.

That does it for the project setup. Now let's add the Sceneform ArFragment to the view layout.
