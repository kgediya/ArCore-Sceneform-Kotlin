## Add the Sceneform plugin for Android Studio

Sceneform has an Android Studio plugin which assists in importing 3D models, adding them to the gradle file, and providing a preview of the model.

You can install this by selecting  **File->Settings**  or  **Preferences**  from Android Studio, then the  **Plugins**  section and "**Browse Repositories...**" for  **"Google Sceneform Tools (Beta)"**. If the plugin doesn't appear, double check the version of Android Studio. Google Sceneform Tools requires Android Studio 3.1 or later version
