## Add sample 3D models to the project

Android Studio 3.1 supports a new folder type named "**sampledata**". This folder is used for design time sample data. For our purposes, we'll keep the source 3D assets in this directory. Files in sampledata are not added to the APK, but available in the editor. To make sceneform compatible models, we'll add the conversion tasks to gradle and add them to the assets directory so they are available at runtime.

Create the sample data directory by clicking on  **`app`**  in the project view and then right mouse click to find the menu item  **New > Sample Data Directory.**

Download the  [sampledata.zip](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/sceneform-intro/raw/master/sampledata.zip) resources from GitHub. This contains 2 directories:

-   **`models`**  - copy this to  **`app/sampledata`**
-   **`Thumbnails`** `-`  copy the files to  **`app/src/main/res/drawable`**
