## Import the models

There are 4 models to use for the codelab to build a "table-top" scaled scene, as opposed to a "room-scale" scene). These models should now be in  **`app/sampledata/models`**  (if they are not, go back one step, and copy the models). The models have multiple files associated with one object. The main model files are:

-   andy_dance.fbx - Our friendly Android.
-   Cabin.obj - A model of a log cabin.
-   House.obj - A model of a house.
-   Igloo.obj - A model of an igloo.

All these models are authored by Google and covered by the CC-BY license. You can find them and lots of other models at the [Poly website](https://poly.google.com/).

We'll use the Sceneform plugin to add the conversion tasks to the build.gradle file and preview the models.

Select **app/sampledata/models/andy_dance.fbx**  and then right mouse click to get the menu and pick  **New > Sceneform asset.** This opens the import wizard page with everything initialized to reasonable values.

Hit "+" to add  **Animation Files** and select  **sampledata/models/andy_dance.fbx**.

Press  **Finish** to start the importing of the model.

The output of this import process will be a text  **‘.sfa'**  file which will be compiled into a binary  **‘.sfb'.** The .sfa file contains a json-like specification for the asset and the parameters there may be adjusted by hand. The ‘.sfb' file is the compiled binary resource for use in your application. The Sceneform plugin allows the ‘.sfb' file to opened and adjusted in editor, but note that any edits made will be saved with the ‘.sfa' file and synced into the ‘.sfb' binary asset.

When the import completes, the plugin will open the  **‘.sfb'**  file in the editor. The Sceneform viewer is also opened, showing the imported model:

A common parameter to modify is  **‘scale'**. Add a line with  **scale: 0.25,**  in the ‘model' object. When done it should look like this:

```
model: {
 scale: 0.25,
 attributes: [
   'Position',
   'TexCoord',
   'Orientation',
   'BoneIndices',
   'BoneWeights',
 ],
 collision: {},
 file: 'sampledata/models/andy_dance.fbx',
 name: 'andy_dance',
 recenter: 'root',
},
```

## Convert Cabin.obj

Now convert the other models using the same process for  **`app/sampledata/models/Cabin.obj`**.

You might notice that the Cabin model is a lot bigger than the andy model. This is a common situation in dealing with 3D models. Fortunately, we can adjust the size when converting the model by editing the  **`Cabin.sfa`**  file.

Find the line that has  **`scale:`**  and change the value to  **0.0005**

Save the file and when it rebuilds, the cabin will appear smaller.

## Convert House.obj

The model file is  **`app/sampledata/models/House.obj`**. It does not need any adjustments.

## Convert igloo.obj

The model file is  **`app/sampledata/models/igloo.obj`**. It looks a little big as well, so scale it to  **0.25.**

Now we have our 3D assets, let's add them to the gallery.
